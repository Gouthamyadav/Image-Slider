# Image Slider

An interactive **Image Slider** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to navigate through a sequence of images either manually or automatically. This slider includes smooth transition effects, navigation dots, and is fully responsive for both mobile and desktop devices.

## Features

- **Manual Navigation**: Use "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through the images.
- **Automatic Sliding**: Images transition automatically at a set interval.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade effect for smooth image transitions.
- **Navigation Dots**: Clickable dots to jump directly to a specific image.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for mobile and desktop devices.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the interval time, transition effects, and styling.

## Files Overview

- **`image.html`**: The structure of the image slider, including the image container, navigation buttons, and navigation dots.
- **`image.css`**: Contains all the styling, including the layout of the slider, transitions, and responsiveness.
- **`image.js`**: Powers the interactivity, controlling the image transitions, manual navigation, and automatic sliding.

## How It Works

1. **HTML (`image.html`)**: 
   - The structure of the image slider is defined here. It includes the image container, navigation buttons ("Previous" and "Next"), and clickable dots for direct navigation.
   
2. **CSS (`image.css`)**: 
   - Styles the layout, ensuring the slider looks good on any screen size. It includes styling for images, navigation buttons, and transition effects such as fade.

3. **JavaScript (`image.js`)**: 
   - Handles the interactivity of the slider. It controls the image transitions, moves between slides, and manages the automatic slideshow function.

## Installation

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**: 
   - You can download the project files or clone the repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-slider.git
     ```
   
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project folder and open `image.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

3. **Customization**:
   - **Images**: Replace the `src` attributes of the `<img>` tags inside `image.html` with your own image URLs.
   - **Interval Time**: Adjust the automatic sliding interval by modifying the `setInterval()` function in `image.js`.
   - **Styling**: Edit `image.css` to modify the look of the slider, including the button colors, dot sizes, or transition effects.
